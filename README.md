*higher here means above average total yearly compensation = $185,067<br/>
- Summary: Motivated to learn job market trend, I used data from levels.fyi and ran EDA, Decision Tree model in Python to find interpretable key drivers. Results showed that base salary and stock grant value played important roles. However, gender, race and education didn't have great impact on compensation.<br/>

- Recommendation for higher compensation in Business Analyst and Data Scientist<br/>
A. Data Science title leads to higher pay than Business Analyst, so if possible, go for Data Scientist.<br/>
B. Total yearly compensation among levels across companies varies, and is highly correlated base salary.<br/>
C. Attributes such as Male, White, PhD earn more.<br/>
D. Try to negotiate higher base salary or stock grant value as they plays the first two key drivers for above average total yearly compensation.<br/>
E. For lower base salary (<$136,500): location, company, level come in play to influence your package.<br/>
F. For higher base salary(>$136,500): most influencers are numerical attributes such as base salary, stock grant and bonus.<br/>
G. Due to small dataset, no matter which model I ran, it shows slightly overfitting: accuracy difference between train and test around 0.17%. And 10-fold cross validation is applied to check final accuracy.

- Summary: Inspired by Medium Article in Towards Data Science <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/build-predictive-business-intelligence-with-google-colab-google-data-studio-and-google-sheets-9a5c1559124f">“Build predictive Business Intelligence with Google Colab, Google Data Studio and Google Sheets”</a>, ”, I enhanced code for API connections (through Kaggle, Google Drive, Google Sheets), built the LSTM neural network, and finally displayed real sales and sales prediction in Google Data Studio. <br/> 

- Learning<br/>
A. colab linked to drive<br/>
B. kaggle api to download dataset to drive<br/>
C. build LSTM Neural Network<br/>
D. send data via Google Sheets api<br/>
E. display result in Google Data Studio<br/>
