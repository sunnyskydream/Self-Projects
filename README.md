*higher here means above average total yearly compensation = $185,067<br/><br/>
Recommendation for higher compensation in Business Analyst and Data Scientist<br/>
A. Data Science title leads to higher pay than Business Analyst, so if possible, go for Data Scientist.<br/>
B. Total yearly compensation among levels across companies varies, and is highly correlated base salary.<br/>
C. Attributes such as Male, White, PhD earn more.<br/>
D. Try to negotiate higher base salary or stock grant value as they plays the first two key drivers for above average total yearly compensation.<br/>
E. For lower base salary (<$136,500): location, company, level come in play to influence your package.<br/>
F. For higher base salary(>$136,500): most influencers are numerical attributes such as base salary, stock grant and bonus.<br/>
G. Due to small dataset, no matter which model I ran, it shows slightly overfitting: accuracy difference between train and test around 0.17%. And 10-fold cross validation is applied to check final accuracy.
