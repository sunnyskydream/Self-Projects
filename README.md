*higher here means above average total yearly compensation = $185,067<br/>
- Summary: Defined above average salary for higher salary and ran multiple classification models and find that base salary and stock grant value plays the first two key drivers for total yearly compensation. However, gender, race and education doesn't indicate any high impact on salary triage.<br/>
- Utilized knowledge: Python (EDA, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)<br/>

- Recommendation for higher compensation in Business Analyst and Data Scientist<br/>
A. Data Science title leads to higher pay than Business Analyst, so if possible, go for Data Scientist.<br/>
B. Total yearly compensation among levels across companies varies, and is highly correlated base salary.<br/>
C. Attributes such as Male, White, PhD earn more.<br/>
D. Try to negotiate higher base salary or stock grant value as they plays the first two key drivers for above average total yearly compensation.<br/>
E. For lower base salary (<$136,500): location, company, level come in play to influence your package.<br/>
F. For higher base salary(>$136,500): most influencers are numerical attributes such as base salary, stock grant and bonus.<br/>
G. Due to small dataset, no matter which model I ran, it shows slightly overfitting: accuracy difference between train and test around 0.17%. And 10-fold cross validation is applied to check final accuracy.
